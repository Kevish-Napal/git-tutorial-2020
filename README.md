Git is a powerful system for managing individual and group projects,
including source code and papers.  We will introduce everyday Git
functionality as well as common workflows for individual, small-group,
and community projects.  In addition to contributor roles like preparing
and revising pull requests, we will also explore integrator roles such
as reviewing, merging, and release/branch management, as well as related
services.
